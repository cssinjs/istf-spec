## An attempt to find an interoperable CSSinJS format.

The biggest issue at scale we currently have with all the CSSinJS implementations is that they are not sharable without the runtime.

If we could find a format that is fast an easy to parse and supports all needs of current CSSinJS implementations, it could become a de facto standard for exported CSSinJS.

It could be similar to how CommonJS and ES3 are currently the standard for sharing JavaScript modules on npm.
